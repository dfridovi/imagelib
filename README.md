# imagelib
An image processing library for recreational and scientific use.

## Philosophy
This library is intended for use by recreational photographers, but also by researchers. I have attempted to satisfy both communities: on the one hand, this library attempts to provide useful, user-friendly, fast tools for the practitioner, but on the other hand, it is also written from the ground up, and does not rely extensively on other related implementations. I hope that it is useful, complete, and above all, well-documented.

## General organization
Each code file in this library represents one of the following:

1. A data type used by other files
2. A function intended to be called by a main() function in another file. These functions implement different procedures, for example image sharpening, or blurring, or object detection, or focus detection.

## Functionality
The following functions are currently supported.

## In the works...
The following functionality will be added soon!
* Variable image sharpening
* Variable image blurring
* Deconvolution (blind/non-blind)
* Focus detection
* Object detection
